        <p>Welcome to JABS (Just About Blood Sugar). By accessing or using our website and services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <h2>1. Services</h2>
        <p>JABS provides diabetes coaching, education, and support. All information provided is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice. Please consult your healthcare provider for medical concerns. Any advice offered is purely based on anecdotal experiences of the diabetes coach, Johnny Bailey. No advice shall be offered regarding insulin dosage or prescriptive medicines. If consent is given, diabetes teams will be contacted by JABS after the first coaching session explaining our services and acknowledging that their support will be needed for insulin changes and medical advice, which will be requested by the client. JABS accepts no responsibility for any prescriptive changes as JABS is not qualified or allowed to offer such advice. This is made clear here in the Terms and Conditions and will be reiterated throughout coaching sessions for total transparency.
